<h1>Project bradleyross-examples</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a
   number of examples and demonstrations for Java
   applications and Application Servers.  The documentation
   (this page) is located at 
   <a href="http://bradleyross.github.io/bradleyross-examples" target="_blank">
   http://bradleyross.github.io/bradleyross-examples</a> while the
   project itself is at
   <a href="http://github.com/BradleyRoss/bradleyross-examples" target=_blank">
   http://github.com/Bradleyross/bradleyross-examples</a>.</p>
<p>These are a number of programs that I have developed over the years, and I am
   reviewing them as I place them in this collection to make sure that I have the
   correct jar files and that they will work in Tomcat without warnings or
   error messages.  However, I hope that you will find them useful in their current state.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="javadocs" target="_blank">Javadocs</a> These are the Javadocs
    for the Java classes.</li>
<li><a href="javascript/index.html" target="_blank">Some examples using JavaScript</a>  These pages
    were copied from the bradleyross-examples project so tht they can be seen without
    having to load the project into an application server.</li>

    sample database.  I have used this code to create tables in both Postgres
    and MySQL.</li>
